# Neutron detection Example

This example demonstrate the possibility to simulate neutron detection by conversion using neutron capture media. A Timepix3 detector with a Boron10/Polyethylene thin coating is exposed to a source of neutrons with a energy of 0.025 eV / 10 MeV. 

The physics list QGSP_BERT_HP is used.


## Thermal neutrons with B10

Neutrons are captured by the Boron and a Lithium ion plus an alpha particle are emmited. Each detector detects one of the emmited particles. The Measurement of both decay products allow for a precise determination of the neutron origin. 


## Fast neutron detection with polyethylene

For the polyethylene target, the neutron interact in the PE layer and a recoil proton is emmited and detected in the Silicon detector.
